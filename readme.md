Nuke
====

Atomic CSS for Haxe.

About
-----

This is an attempt to create something like [Otin](https://github.com/kripod/otion) for Haxe. Still way too early to be useful yet.

It's main benefit is that it uses Haxe's macro system to automatically check if an atom is dynamic or static, and can extract all static atoms and place them in an external CSS file. Ideally, Nuke should be able to compile itself away and just leave some class names at runtime.
